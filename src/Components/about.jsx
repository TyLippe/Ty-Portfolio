            <p>My name is Ty Lippe and I am a Full Stack Developer, but let me tell you a bit more about how I got to this point. I graduated high school in 2012 and since have been in and out of classes while also working warehouse positions. Since my first cell phone I have been hooked on tech and knew that one day I would make it more than just a hobby, but I would make it my career. If we go back to March 2019 you would find that I am researching Lambda School and how it could change everything for me and my family. Needless to say, I took the jump and one year later I have learned so much more than I have ever, I also have met so many amazing people in this industry and worked with some great people. Lambda School has made me what I am today, I know that this is only the beginning and that excites me! Please feel free to enjoy the rest of my portfolio and find my contact info at the bottom of the page.
